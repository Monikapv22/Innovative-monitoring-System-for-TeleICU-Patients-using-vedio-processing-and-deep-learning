# Innovative-monitoring-System-for-TeleICU-Patients-using-vedio-processing-and-deep-learning
    
  This Project proposes an advanced monitoring System for teleICU patients,integrating video processing and deep learning technologies.the system aims to enhance patients monitoring,reduce response times,and improve overall patient outcomes in intensive care units by analyzing real-time video feeds to detect critical events and anomolies.



  # How we built it





YOLOv8: Used for object detection and classification.

Python: Served as the primary language for scripting and model development.

OpenCV: Handled video processing tasks.

NumPy: Facilitated numerical operations.

Streamlit: Enabled us to create the web application interface.

PyTorch: Assisted in loading and running the YOLO models.

Roboflow: Managed dataset labeling and organization.
